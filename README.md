## a quick reminder about Github

### Important Git Concepts
- first time using Git: use config --global with the username and email
- creating repositories, setting up the SSH key or token, cloning the repository
- commits - snapshots of the project at a certain time 
- branches - allow working on features separately from the main code

### common Git commands
- git clone + url  → will copy a repo from GitHub to a local machine
- git add (file) → marks the file changes for committing
- git commit → saves the changes in the local repository
- `git push → uploades the local changes to GitHub
- `git pull → downloades the changes from GitHub
- `git diff → so you can see the diffrences between the current working directory and the last commited version
- `git merge → combines the changes from one branch into another
- `git checkout  → changes working branches
### Other things
- a common conflict! - When the same file in the same branch has been edited independently by different users/machines!!!
